# Secure Voting Protocol

This project implements a secure voting protocol designed to ensure **four fundamental security properties**:

- ‚úÖ **Authentication** of voters  
- üîê **Confidentiality** of votes  
- ‚úÖ **Integrity** of ballots  
- üïµÔ∏è **Anonymity** of voters  

The system is logically divided into two core phases: **Authentication** and **Voting**.

## üîë Authentication Phase

1. **Voter Login with Nonce**  
   The voter initiates authentication by entering their username and generating a one-time random **nonce**.  
   They compute a digest:  h(password || nonce)
   
and send it to the **Election Authority (EA)**. The EA verifies this using its securely stored password hashes.

‚úÖ This mechanism prevents:
- Password exposure in plaintext  
- Replay attacks via one-time nonces  
- Impersonation without password knowledge

2. **Key Exchange and Token Issuance**  
- Once authenticated, the EA sends its **Diffie-Hellman (DH) public key** and **RSA-signed certificate** to the voter.  
- The voter verifies the certificate to confirm EA‚Äôs identity.  
- The voter then:
  - Generates their own DH key pair  
  - Computes a shared session key `Ks = g^ab mod p`  
  - Creates a **pseudonymous token** (UUID format)  
  - Encrypts the token using the shared key `Ks`  
  - Sends the encrypted token to the EA  

3. **Token Signing by EA**  
- EA decrypts the token and signs it with its **RSA private key**  
- The signed token is encrypted again using `Ks` and returned to the voter  
- EA records that the voter has been issued a signed token (to prevent multiple voting)

üõ°Ô∏è **Security Goals Achieved in this Phase**:
- **Confidentiality**: The token is only visible to the voter and EA  
- **Integrity**: The signed token proves it hasn't been tampered  
- **Authentication**: Both voter and EA verify each other  
- **Anonymity**: The token contains no voter-identifiable data

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting Phase

1. **Vote Commitment**  
- The voter selects a candidate  
- Computes a **ballot** using:
  ```
  h(vote)
  ```
  This commits to their choice *without revealing* the vote itself.

2. **Payload Preparation**  
The voter creates a payload consisting of:
- Ballot hash  
- Timestamp  
- Token  
- Signed token  

This is **encrypted using EA‚Äôs RSA public key** and sent.

3. **EA Vote Processing**  
EA decrypts the payload and:
- Validates the **timestamp** (must be recent)  
- Verifies **signature on token** to ensure it's legitimate  
- Ensures **token is issued only once per voter**

4. **Ballot Storage**  
- If valid, the hashed ballot is stored  
- No user identity is ever stored with the ballot

5. **Vote Tallying**  
- After voting ends, EA compares stored ballot hashes against known candidate name hashes:
  ```
  h("A. Alice"), h("B. Bob"), ...
  ```
- Votes are counted by matching these hashes

üõ°Ô∏è **Security Goals Achieved in this Phase**:
- **Anonymity**: Only ballot hash is stored  
- **Integrity**: Only valid signed tokens are accepted  
- **Confidentiality**: Vote payload is encrypted  
- **Freshness**: Timestamp must be within allowed time window
